## Python Intro for OS
### Purpose
---
This repository contains the code for the python introduction lab. The
purpose is to have a fairly simple python assignment that introduces
the basic features and tools of python

### About
---
In the repository are two plain text files with lots of words. 
Create a python 3 program which:
* takes as input the name of an input file and output file
* example

`$ python wordCount.py input.txt output.txt`
* keeps track of the total the number of times each word occurs in the text file 
* excluding white space and punctuation
* is case-insensitive
* print out to the output file (overwriting if it exists) the list of
  words sorted in descending order with their respective totals
  separated by a space, one word per line

### Testing
---
The wordCountTest.py and two text files will take the output file and notes any
differences with the key file. An example use is:

`$ python wordCountTest.py declaration.txt myOutput.txt declarationKey.txt`

The re regular expression library and python dictionaries should be
used in your program.
